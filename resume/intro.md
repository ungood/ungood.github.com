# Jason Walker

I am a full-stack, principal software engineer that is passionate about code craftsmanship, devops, and building cool things. I started my career as a web development contractor, before jQuery made everything "easy". I transitioned from that into a back-end engineer writing reverse logistics software for Amazon ReCommerce, and then further down the stack integrating automated sorting and packing machine for Amazon Robotics. Currently I am working on Amazon's Project Kuiper, trying to deliver satellite internet to the world.
